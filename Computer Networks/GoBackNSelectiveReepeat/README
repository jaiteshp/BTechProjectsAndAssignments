The SR directory contains the implementation of Selective Repeat Protocol
The GBN directory contains the implementation of GO Back N Protocol

All the Data collected in the report was done mostly using
1. MAX_PACKETS = 400
2. Window_size = 4
3. Buffer_size = 100
4. Sequence_Bits = 8

In the implementation of both protocols, the arrays are initialised(for recording RTT,..) to a size of 10000. 
So, if the MAX_PACKETS to be give via command line are more than that(10000), we have to change the initialisation size in the program.
else, (when MAX_PACKETS < 10000), MAX_PACKETS can be normally given via command line interface.


In python, it is not possible to create a data packet which is exactly of required size. So the packets I created are very closed to required packet length but are not of size exactly equal to packet length
